Some observations noticed in the data was that age groups 16-20 took longer trips but not as often as 31-40 yr olds. The data seemed to indicated that
16-20 year olds really didn't take that many trips throughout the months evaluated. This could indicate there is an issue in the data, or I manipulated
it wrong. Prior to the lockdown beginning in March 2020, there were two distinct hours of high traffic: 8 AM, 5PM, and 6PM. This makes sense because at 
8 AM people are usually heading into work, while people head home between 5 and 6 PM. Prior to the lockdown Grove St. PATH had higher bike trips starting 
from the station. This is most likely due because it connects Jersey City to Manhattan and the station is used by commuters heading to and from work. 
Following the lockdown in March 2020 up until June 2020, the number of bike trips starting from Grove St. PATH decreased with an increase noticed in Liberty 
Light Rail and Newport Pkwy. The hours of higher traffic also decreased to just 6 PM due to people not having to commute to work given the new workplace 
restrictions. An increase in bike trips at 6 PM could be people trying to enjoy the outdoor following a day of work. Data also showed that males seemed to 
use the bikes more often than females, and that did not change pre or post lockdown. However, the number of trips taken by females did increase following the 
lockdown to June 2020.
